## 🎯 The Problem This Solves

**Machine learning development suffers from a measurement crisis.** Teams struggle with:

- 🚫 **Unreproducible experiments** - "It worked on my machine"
- 📊 **Inconsistent performance tracking** - Memory usage? FLOPS? Carbon footprint?
- 🎲 **Statistical naivety** - No proper A/B testing or significance testing
- 🌍 **Sustainability blindness** - Unknown environmental impact of training runs
- 🔧 **Tool fragmentation** - Different tools for logging, profiling, and validation

**The cost?** Wasted compute resources, unreliable results, and missed optimization opportunities that can make the difference between research success and production deployment.

# Get comprehensive metrics
metrics = profiler.get_metrics()
print(f"Peak RAM: {metrics.memory.peak_ram_mb:.1f} MB")
